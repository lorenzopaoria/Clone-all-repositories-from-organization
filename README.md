# Clone All GitHub Repositories from an Organization

This Python script automates the cloning of all repositories within a specified GitHub organization. With the help of a GitHub personal access token, the script fetches and clones every repository accessible to the token, creating a local folder with the name of the organization and saving each repository within it.

## Requirements

To use this script, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Python** (3.6 or later)
* **Git** (for cloning repositories)

## Setup and Usage

### Step 1: Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token

1. Go to GitHub Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens.
2. Click **Generate new token** and select the following permissions:
   * `repo` (to access private repositories, if needed)
   * `read:org` (to read organization information)
3. Copy the token; you'll need it for the script.

### Step 2: Configure the Script

1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `clone_all_repos.py` in a text editor.
3. Replace the placeholders in the script with your actual information:
   * Replace `"ACCESS_TOKEN"` with your GitHub personal access token.
   * Replace `"ORG_NAME"` with the name of the GitHub organization you wish to clone repositories from.

### Step 3: Run the Script

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the script.
2. Run the following command:

   ```
   python clone_all_repos.py
   ```

   The script will start cloning all the repositories within the specified organization, creating a new folder with the organization's name and saving each repository inside.

## Notes

- The script will automatically create the organization folder if it doesn't exist.
- If a repository is private and your access token doesn't have permission to access it, the script will skip that repository.
- The script will not overwrite existing repositories; it will only clone new ones.
- The script can be customized further by modifying the code, such as adding error handling, progress indicators, or other features.

Enjoy automating your GitHub repository cloning process!
